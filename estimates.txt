1) Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage
We assume that single AZ outage happen, the recovery time objective (RTO) is total of the time that the process of recovery data will take 
and generate a new database (db) identifier which replicated form the original db. So RTO is about under 10 mintues.

2) Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage
RPO focus on preventing the data loss, so it will describe about the time interval from disrupted event. 
For example, we define RPO for 1 hour so the transaction in that time can be safe in the event of a disaster.

3) Minimum RTO for a single region outage
For the single region outage, it can be take 5 minutes to promote a database from replica mode to standalone database.

4) Minimum RPO for a single region outage
We have some types of RPO as Multi-AZ deployments, it can be take under 10 minutes to achive that with structure of the Udacity lab.
